# GenstageSample

Very minimal GenStage test with a Producer, a ProducerConsumer and a Consumer to learn the basics of how GenStage works.

Producer generates numbers, ProducerConsumer filters out everything that doesn't produce "FizzBuzz" in the classic FizzBuzz test, and Consumer prints those numbers to the terminal.
